# COVID-19 Detection 

## Overview
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the ResNet50 architecture to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. The model was trained on a dataset with 148 examples and achieved an accuracy of 97.5%.

## Files
- `code.ipynb`: Contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `model.h5`: The trained model file.
- `COVID DataSet.zip`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 97.5%
- **Training Data:** 148 X-ray images

## Usage
1. **Extract the Dataset**: Unzip `COVID DataSet.zip` to access the training and testing images.
2. **Load the Notebook**: Open `code.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. **Run the Code**: Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. **Load the Model**: To use the pre-trained model, load `model.h5` within the notebook.
